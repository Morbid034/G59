    <h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>You did good, $lick<br>
        It's a SMASH!<br>
        Pla-pla-pla-players never die<br>
        <br>
        Draped up and dripped out<br>
        Know what I'm talkin' 'bout<br>
        Three in the mornin', gettin' the gat out the stash spot<br>
        Drape-, drape-, drape-, drape-<br>
        Draped up and dripped out<br>
        Know what I'm talkin' 'bout<br>
        Three in the mornin', gettin' the gat out the stash spot<br>
        Drape-, drape-, drape-, drape-<br>
        <br>
        I got five bullets left in my nine<br>
        Grey matted Glock, looking to fuck up someone's spine<br>
        Mane, I do this all the time<br>
        Yeah, I might be Cherry but my haters all pie<br>
        See the reaper smiling when you look me in my eye (In my eye)<br>
        Ridin' down Marconi, got my Tony on me<br>
        My whip look like heavy cream, inside pepperoni<br>
        Fleetwood day dreamin' but I'll never let ‘em step up on me<br>
        Shoutout all my Florida and my Texas homies (My Texas homies)<br>
        Got my gut sticking out, I'm from fat city<br>
        Everytime I hit the block, them cops is acting piggy<br>
        Blanco never left the 7th Ward, from LA to New York<br>
        Yeah, you know I settle scores<br>
        I try to keep y'all up to date on my escapades<br>
        PS5 up in the Escalade, riding down esplanade<br>
        Wock up in my lemonade, now them demons in my head to get some shade<br>
        Pull the tool out then look at the mess I made<br>
        I can't fix shit but my desire to get high<br>
        All my homies that done died, they all watch me from the sky<br>
        Life can be fucked up, but I'm glad to be here<br>
        Lookin’ for the love, but instead I see fear<br>
        Shawty saw my dick, like when headlights meet deer<br>
        I told her, Turn around, then I pulled her rear near<br>
        I told her, Listen up, like you got like three ears<br>
        You my whole world, I can't even see spheres<br>
        <br>
        Draped up and dripped out<br>
        Know what I'm talkin' 'bout<br>
        Three in the mornin', gettin' the gat out the stash spot<br>
        Drape-, drape-, drape-, drape-<br>
        <br>
        Pull up playa mackin'<br>
        Bought my bitch her back end<br>
        Whip self-park, gettin' head while I back-in<br>
        Mane, I'm getting paid just to sigh and breathe it back in<br>
        Used to cash change for some cigs, $5 on pump ten<br>
        Northside superstar (North!), pull up just to piss 'em off<br>
        Shawty see my bills, I said: It’s nil to what this kitchen cost<br>
        Show you how to pimp a broad, show you how to lift the cross<br>
        Playas up, suckers down, pussies I just kill 'em off<br>
        Tipping 4’s on 'em hoes, $lick don't usually talk a lot<br>
        Ridin' with some guns that turn your home into a parking lot<br>
        Fire up a Swisher Sweet, eyes looking bittersweet<br>
        Broken Heart Shorty, but it's yet to miss a fucking beat<br>
        Three in the morning, it's just me and Screw, mane<br>
        Too many thangs I wish that wasn't true, mane<br>
        Been pimping keys like I'm Stephen Hough<br>
        Germans growling, sounding like a European Zoo<br>
        What it do? Foreign 'Cedes and a Caddy slab<br>
        Caddy for my dad, bought my girl a new Macan<br>
        Northern Lands, Southside, that's where I began (7th Ward!)<br>
        I'm rolling vengeance that’s forever like I'm Warren Van<br>
        Sail through the South, gold in my mouth<br>
        Ball on these hoes like I'm Luka Downtown, mane<br>
        One for the money, two 30's for pain<br>
        Xan' for my nerves, only way I stay sane, mane<br>
        <br>
        W-What it do? Foreign 'Cedes and a Caddy slab<br>
        Caddy for my dad, bought my girl a new Macan<br>
        Riding down esplanade, riding down esplanade, in the Escalade<br>
        Wock up in my lemonade, demons in-in-in my<br>
        What it do? What-what-what-what it-what it do?<br>
        Bla-Bla-Blanco never left the 7th Ward, never left the 7th Ward</p><br>
