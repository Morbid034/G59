    <h2>Letra</h2>
    <p>(You did good Slick)<br>
        (It's a Smash!)<br>
        Wetto, Wetto, Wetto<br>
        Wetto, Wetto, Wetto<br>
        Wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet, wet<br>
        <br>
        I got the Glock in my yoga pants<br>
        Fucking that bitch in a yoga stance<br>
        Swangin' that K' with an open stance<br>
        Loaded from smoking that opium<br>
        Stain a lil' boy in the clothes he's in<br>
        All of my walls, they closing in<br>
        51/50, they tryna come get me<br>
        Just minding my business and moseying<br>
        Matte black, smokin' packs<br>
        Panic attacks, back to back<br>
        Xanax on my lap, debating, should I relapse?<br>
        But back to the hoe I was talkin' 'bout<br>
        I just wanna put it up in her mouth<br>
        Pimping up in my blood, what's up 'cause?<br>
        Thuggin' that dirty South<br>
        Four letters, two numbers, bitch, Grey*59<br>
        Three fingers in the air, main bitch by my side<br>
        Slicky pull up in a quartеr mill' and slaughter up your daughter<br>
        Yung Jesus with thеm Forgi wheels don't walk, he drive on water<br>
        Anytime, any place, any hood, any state<br>
        Good till it fuckin' ain't, woods to the fucking face<br>
        Ridin' with my baby sage, lines on expensive plates<br>
        Tears on my diamond chains, stoic, never looking phased<br>
        Poet when I'm spitting game (Game)<br>
        Show me how that pussy shaved (Shaved)<br>
        Dosage climbin' with my shame (Shame)<br>
        Mama crying for my pain (Pain)<br>
        Will they ever understand? (No)<br>
        Can I even help my dad? (No)<br>
        Money fuckin' up my fam', giving until there's nothing left<br>
        Pulling up in that latest (Damn!)<br>
        Choppa stay on me, don't need no hands<br>
        Prefer to be lonely, don't need no friends<br>
        Hoe we just fucking, I don't date fans<br>
        I'm with my cousin and talkin' plans<br>
        Went to my hood and I copped some land<br>
        Blowing through my money like Democrats<br>
        Two-step on the IRS, fuck a tax<br>
        <br>
        Why the fuck you look to me for help?<br>
        There ain't an ace in the cards I was dealt<br>
        I'm 31, still don't know how to take care of myself<br>
        Honestly, I'm scared that I might melt<br>
        Leave behind a bunch of black spots on a white pelt<br>
        Maybe in the next life I'll come back as a nice belt, Ion' know<br>
        There's a fine line between me and you<br>
        The biggest difference is I'll snort that shit and probably puke<br>
        Dodge and juke all the bullshit y'all try and pull me through<br>
        But I'm still shining, baby girl wylin'<br>
        Catch me riding by with that look in my eyes<br>
        Palms start to sweat, by the way I'm gripping my. 9<br>
        Yeah, I'm always on my toes, but I'm still the same height<br>
        Standing tall over my grave<br>
        Make sure it's filled with all the people we supposedly saved<br>
        Make sure you throw the plaques in and all the money we made<br>
        I can't put them on my wall, that shit just ain't my taste<br>
        It ain't my taste, it ain't my taste!<br>
        Lil Shawty wanna marry me, I said: You're better off in debt<br>
        If it didn't work out baby, I'll be real hard to forget<br>
        German whips and private jets, private beaches to access<br>
        Fuck on me baby, I'm still a mess and no that ain't a threat<br>
        I ride for my family that's Grey59<br>
        Try and be all I can be and not waste my time<br>
        On the brink of insanity, I can't make up my mind<br>
        Yeah, I battle my vanity and I think I'm blind<br>
        <br>
        Four letters, two numbers, bitch, Grey59<br>
        Three fingers in the air<br>
        Three fingers in the air<br>
        Four letters, two numbers, bitch, Grey59<br>
        Three fingers in the air, m-<br>
        Three fingers in the air, main<br>
        I ride for my family that's Grey59<br>
        I ride for my family that's Grey59<br>
        <br>
        Try and be all I can be and I waste my ti-ti-ti-time<br>
        Try and be all I can be and I waste my time</p><br>
